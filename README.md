Unlock the open source, public prediction network. 

You can use this template to periodically top up your WRITE_KEY's balance using GitHub Actions, allowing you to publish streams (or make predictions) indefinitely. See [Microprediction.Com](https://www.microprediction.com/) if you are not yet familiar with the prediction network project.
